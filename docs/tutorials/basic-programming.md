# Basic Programming

In this framework we use 2 programming languages, and 2 frameworks.

1. TypeScript
2. HTML
3. Vue 3
4. Tailwind CSS

This entire stack is how the entire framework is built, and ran and you'll be using the same stack.

## How to Learn

!!!

Programming is not easy, but starting is easier.

!!!

These are some general tips to learn faster.

1. Learning requires persistent dedication throughout the week. Try to spend 1 or 2 hours learning a concept or building something

2. Learning just before bed helps you retain the information better

3. If you are having fun, keep pushing forward because motivation helps you learn faster

4. If a concept is too hard to learn, step away for a bit and come back

5. If you have headaches, take a day off and come back tomorrow

6. If you are not physically writing code, you are not physically learning anything

## TypeScript Basics

This is an incredibly basic tutorial and should cover a good chunk of what you need.

The only way to learn these programming languages is to mess around with them, try making plugins and doing basic things before building a giant roleplay gamemode. We all started off writing very small programs when we started.

## Vue 3 Basics

While Vue is harder to learn if you're not familiar with any HTML Frameworks, it's well worth the time to speed up development.

Here's an incredibly thorough course that will teach you some stuff.
