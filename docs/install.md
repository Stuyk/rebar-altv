# Install & Upgrade

!!!
Hey listen! When you run Rebar for the first time, you won't be able to spawn.

This is simply for server setup, and getting started.

Check out some [Plugins](<https://forge.plebmasters.de/hub?targetFrameworks=Rebar+(alt:V)&contentType=Script>) to get everything working!
!!!

## 1. Programs to Install

Install these programs.

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
-   [MongoDB Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
    -   Ensure that if you are running it locally, do not set a database password.
    -   When you move your server to production use something like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

If you are having trouble installing `pnpm` you can run this command in a `Powershell Window` with `Admin` **Enabled**.

```
set-executionpolicy unrestricted
```

These are optional but recommended if developing
